a few prerequirements:
1) install sshpass: sudo apt-get install sshpass
(in a future version ssh keys will be supported likely)

2) read every note files located in the subfolders,
especially the helper's one, you need to compile a programm before you can start.


3) Make sure no illegal characters like ' and euro char are used in the password
(is a TODO)
test the rsync conf with the test script before you start the backup script:
/bin/dash test_rsync.sh

ENJOY IT AND HAVE FUN
